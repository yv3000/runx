# 🚀 Runx

### Universal Project Launcher with Portable Runtimes

Run projects with the exact runtime versions they require — **without installing Node.js, Python, or other runtimes globally.**

# Why Runx?

Modern development often requires multiple runtime versions.

One project needs:

- Node.js 20
- Python 3.11

Another needs:

- Node.js 18
- Python 3.10

Installing and managing these globally quickly becomes difficult.

**Runx solves this problem.**

Runx automatically downloads the exact runtime versions required by a project, stores them in a local cache, and runs commands inside an isolated environment.

No global installations.

No PATH pollution.

No version managers.

---

# ✨ Features

- 🚀 Zero global runtime installation
- 📦 Automatic runtime downloads
- 💾 Intelligent runtime cache
- 🔒 Isolated execution environment
- ⚡ Fast startup after first download
- 🖥 Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- ⚙ Configuration using `runx.toml`
- 🦀 Built with Rust
- 🔄 Deterministic project environments
- 🔧 GitHub Releases & CI/CD

# Installation

## macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aryankahar31/runx/main/install.sh | sh
```

---

## Windows PowerShell

```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aryankahar31/runx/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

---

Verify installation

```bash
runx --version
```

Expected output

```
runx 0.1.0
```

---

# Quick Start

Initialize a project

```bash
runx init
```

This creates

```text
runx.toml
```

Configure your project

```toml
[runtimes]
node = "20.11.0"
python = "3.11.7"

[run]
dev = "npm run dev"
build = "npm run build"
test = "npm test"
```

Run your application

```bash
runx dev
```

---

# Example

Project

```
my-project/
│
├── package.json
├── runx.toml
└── src/
```

package.json

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node index.js"
  }
}
```

index.js

```javascript
console.log("Hello from Runx!");
```

Run

```bash
runx dev
```

Output

```
Installing node 20.11.0
Downloading...
Extracting...

Running npm run dev

Hello from Runx!
```

Second run

```
Using cached node 20.11.0

Running npm run dev

Hello from Runx!
```

---

# Runtime Cache

Downloaded runtimes are stored in

```
~/.runx/runtimes/
```

Example

```
~/.runx/runtimes/

node/
└──20.11.0/

python/
└──3.11.7/
```

Runx automatically reuses cached runtimes.

No repeated downloads.

# Architecture

# How It Works

1. Read `runx.toml`
2. Resolve runtime versions
3. Check local cache
4. Download missing runtime
5. Extract portable runtime
6. Build isolated PATH
7. Execute command

---

# Isolation

Runx never modifies

- Global PATH
- Shell startup files
- System-installed runtimes
- User environment

Instead, every command runs inside an isolated environment using only the configured runtimes.
